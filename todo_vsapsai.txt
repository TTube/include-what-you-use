Investigate if IWYU produces forward declarations both in .h file and in .cc

test that forward declaration in discarded file is ignored
test that forward declaration in full-use file stays
fwd-decl problems:
	multiple forward declarations in the same line
	forward declaration(s) on multiple lines

Implement OneUse::suggested_inclusion_kind(). It may depend on public headers, decl_filepath

See into OneUse::has_suggested_header, when it is set

It is a little bit strange that in CalculateIwyuForForwardDeclareUse we emit
> Ignoring fwd-decl use of Impl (tests/mirror_objc.h:4:3): have definition at tests/mirror_objc-i1.h:1:7
because we actually not ignoring it later

Crude outline:
	Class as superclass needs import
	Class as ivar needs fwd-declare
		don't add one if there is already fwd-declare
	Class as method argument/return type needs fwd-declare
	Same for protocols
	Implementation files
		need class when call some method on its instance
		don't need class if just pass around variable
