Investigate if IWYU produces forward declarations both in .h file and in .cc
	if forward declaration in .h file is good enough to be used in .cc

test that forward declaration in discarded file is ignored
test that forward declaration in full-use file stays
fwd-decl problems:
	multiple forward declarations in the same line
	forward declaration(s) on multiple lines

Implement OneUse::suggested_inclusion_kind(). It may depend on public headers, decl_filepath

See into OneUse::has_suggested_header, when it is set

It is a little bit strange that in CalculateIwyuForForwardDeclareUse we emit
> Ignoring fwd-decl use of Impl (tests/mirror_objc.h:4:3): have definition at tests/mirror_objc-i1.h:1:7
because we actually not ignoring it later

TODO: see how in clang we arrive to a warning "may not respond to selector"
call methods for |id| variables, not with nice explicit type
call category method
call protocol method
call method declared in superclass
call method declared in superclass category (need both class and category?)
synthesize property (it implies retain, release, copy are called for property type. Still need to decide if need the entire class or only class which contains retain, release, copy i.e. NSObject)

nil usage: "nil is defined in <objc/objc.h>, which isn't directly #included."
TODO: test struct property, e.g. @property (assign) NSSize frame;

Crude outline:
	Class as superclass needs import
	Class as ivar needs fwd-declare
		don't add one if there is already fwd-declare
	Class as method argument/return type needs fwd-declare
	Same for protocols
	Implementation files
		need class when call some method on its instance
		don't need class if just pass around variable
