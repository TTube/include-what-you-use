Investigate if IWYU produces forward declarations both in .h file and in .cc

GetClassRedecls is empty set for ObjCInterfaceDecl, see what consequences it can cause
GetDefinitionForClass. Looks like as result we set is_iwyu_violation_ to true and print unnecessary warning message
//TODO: find out test cases which fail for these particular scenarios

See into OneUse::has_suggested_header, when it is set

It is a little bit strange that in CalculateIwyuForForwardDeclareUse we emit
> Ignoring fwd-decl use of Impl (tests/mirror_objc.h:4:3): have definition at tests/mirror_objc-i1.h:1:7
because we actually not ignoring it later

Crude outline:
	Class as superclass needs import
	Class as ivar needs fwd-declare
		don't add one if there is already fwd-declare
	Class as method argument/return type needs fwd-declare
	Same for protocols
	Implementation files
		need class when call some method on its instance
		don't need class if just pass around variable
